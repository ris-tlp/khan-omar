# khan-omar
Collaboration with Omar to build a website.

# Getting Started
1. Download and install Git for windows [here](http://git-scm.com/download/win). You can use [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=albr1o7Z1nw) for reference. Follow the steps in the video till 4:54.
2. To understand SCM better, watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oRjP8yj2Wo). You can read up some articles on this as well.
3. I've added your user `ris-tlp` as a collaborator for this repository. Login to github and accept the invite.
4. Let's use Visual Studio Code as the IDE for development. You can download and install the community version [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
5. Define your local workspace. I like to keep my git projects under one folder and recommend yours to be `C:\workspace\`
6. Open git-bash and change your current directory to the local workspace. This command shell will use unix commands which is slightly different from the windows command prompt. That's ok, you'll learn along the way. The command is - <br><br>
`cd C:/workspace` <br><br>
To verify you're in the right place type in <br><br>
`pwd` <br><br>
The cmd will tell you the present working directory which should be `C:/workspace`<br>
7. Now comes the cool part, in the same cmd window, issue the following command - <br><br>
`git clone https://github.com/shaeqkhan/khan-omar.git` <br><br>
You should see a folder `khan-omar` in your workspace `C:\workspace\khan-omar`<br><br>
Message me once you're done, pat yourself on the back and then we'll talk about making the website.
